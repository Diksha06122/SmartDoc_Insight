 # SmartDoc Insight

SmartDoc Insight reads text from URLs, PDFs, and documents to answer queries using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Hugging Face embeddings. It utilizes FAISS, a vector database, for efficient retrieval and management of embeddings, providing quick and relevant responses to enhance document interaction and knowledge extraction.

## Key Features

- **Multi-source Document Reading**: Capable of extracting text from URLs, PDFs, and text documents.
- **Advanced Query Answering**: Utilizes RAG and Hugging Face embeddings for accurate responses.
- **Efficient Data Management**: Employs FAISS for fast and efficient embedding retrieval.
- **Context-aware Interaction**: Enhances document interaction and knowledge extraction with context-aware insights.

## Technologies Used

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines retrieval-based and generative models to improve response relevance and accuracy.
- **Hugging Face Embeddings**: Provides state-of-the-art embeddings for natural language understanding.
- **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)**: A vector database optimized for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
